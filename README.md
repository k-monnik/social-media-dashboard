# Social Media Dashboard

This is a social media dashboard landing page with a dark/light theme switcher.

Users should be able to:
- view the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- see hover states for all interactive elements on the page (cards and toggle switch)
- toggle color theme to their preference

This is a solution to the [Social Media Dashboard challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-media-dashboard-with-theme-switcher-6oY8ozp_H).

## My process


### Built with

- React
- JSX
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework


### What I learned

With this project, I had fun learning how to implement the dark/light theme switcher using JavaScript and styling the toggle switch using Tailwind. The Tailwind `dark` variant made it simple to style the various theme color changes throughout the project.


### Future iterations

I will be adding gradient color styling to a few elements soon.
